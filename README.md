## Atari Breakout Reinforcement Learning

This repository contains code for training an agent to play the Atari Breakout game using Deep Q-Learning. The agent is implemented and trained using TensorFlow and stable-baselines libraries. Below is a guide on how to set up the environment, train the agent, and observe its performance.

### Installation and Dependencies

To get started, you need to install the required dependencies. You can do this by running the following commands:

```bash
pip install gym[atari]
pip install gym[accept-rom-license]
pip install keras-rl2
pip install stable-baselines[mpi]==2.8.0
pip install unrar
```

### Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/atari-breakout.git
   cd atari-breakout
   ```

2. Open the Jupyter notebook or Python script containing the code.

3. Follow the code sections step by step to set up the environment, create the Deep Q-Network model, configure hyperparameters, train the agent, and observe its performance.

### Code Structure

1. **Installing and importing dependencies:** Install necessary packages and import required libraries for the project.

2. **Examining the Breakout environment:** Understand the game environment, state space, action space, and reward structure.

3. **Creating a model - Deep convolutional neural network:** Define the neural network architecture for the Q-learning agent.

4. **Configuring hyperparameters and model training:**

   - Define hyperparameters such as epsilon values, memory lengths, batch size, etc.
   - Implement the main training loop for the Deep Q-Learning algorithm.

5. **Save and load the model:** Learn how to save and load trained models for later use.

6. **Making videos of the agent's gameplay:** Visualize the agent's performance by creating videos of it playing the game.

7. **Observations:** Analyze the training and test performance of the agent over time.

### Training and Evaluation

The provided code trains the agent using Deep Q-Learning and evaluates its performance. It plots graphs showing cumulative rewards and time steps for both training and test scenarios. The observations section provides insights into the agent's learning progress and effectiveness.

### Disclaimer

This code is intended as a demonstration of using reinforcement learning to train an agent on the Atari Breakout game. The provided code might require adjustments or further customization to suit specific use cases or environments.
